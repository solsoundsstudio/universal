## Inspirations

### [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html)
Grateful and inspired by the progress this ecosystem has made in recent years.

### [People In Space by joreilly](https://github.com/joreilly/PeopleInSpace)
I drew on this project heavily for my first Multiplatform prototype. I tried and discarded several template projects, this one was my favorite. I am grateful for the head start. I did preserve many aspects I liked but I have tried to make it my own.
